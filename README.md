# CS50 Final Project
finance / budgeting web app

2019-11-30

This version of my budgeting web app is built on Flask as a part of CS50 for the final project.

The full scale version will use a database instead of CSV files and will be built on Django as that is a far more popular framework and I have more resources readily available to learn Django over Flask.

I may come back and update this in the future to continue practice with Flask to compare the frameworks (notice the login was not implemented as I did not end up using a database to log the transactions).

Cleaned up the webapp files and uploaded a data file with fictionalized transaction data so I can make the repository public to demonstrate what the web app can do.
I am choosing to leave the edit and delete buttons on the View All Responses page and may add functionality in the future.

To run: clone repo and run flask server on local machine. This was not written to be run anywhere beyond your local computer.


Unfortunately I cannot fork the problem sets over to my repo, as they were uploaded directly to the CS50 account on submission.
