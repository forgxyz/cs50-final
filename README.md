finance web app

2019-11-30
This version of my budgeting web app is built on Flask as a part of CS50 for the final project.

The full scale version will use a database instead of CSV files and will be built on Django as that is a far more popular framework and I have more resources readily available to learn Django over Flask.

I may come back and update this in the future to continue practice with Flask to compare the frameworks (notice the login was not implemented as I did not end up using a database to log the transactions).
